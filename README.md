# LB-ISF
ISF Filters

## Musical

**LB-Lowpass** designed as visual match to sweeping a lowpass filter down

**LB-Highpass** same for highpass

**LB-Drill** visual equivalent of small audio loops, with delay specified in seconds. Toggles two frames at exactly the delay specified. To express audio delays smaller than one frame, you can apply "subframe" to multiply the frame contents.

**LB-Hold** visual equivalent of a spectral freeze or quick infinite reverb hold. Freezes a frame and slowly stretches it into abstractness.

see also LB-TimeDub below.

## Color

**LB-HueDistort** is a hue rotate that operates in perceptually uniform color space, with options for flipping and biasing the color space in order to tease out nice distributions of output colors.

**LB-HueRange** limits the range of hues by mapping colors to avoid part of the color wheel. Options to choose between smooth output with possible color collisions or a unique mapping with a discontinuity.

**LB-Palettize** allows you to specify, in the filter code, a set of 9 colors. Input colors will be posterized to the perceptually nearest palette color. There are some options to force different color mappings in order to find a useful output.

**LB-Print** applies a retro printed look, with CMYK registration offset, paper texture, paper bleed, and optional jitter.

## Time

**LB-PosterizeTime** reduces the frame rate by taking occasional input frames, optionally fading between them. Can make anything chill.

**LB-TimeDub** creates a visual feedback loop of an exact and arbitrarily long delay time. It keeps the memory usage constant by using 8 frames to implement the feedback. Feedback times longer than 8 frames will have a reduced frame rate (an 8 second loop with have one frame per second). Designed as match to reggae-style audio delay.

## Shape

**LB-Circle** Flexible circle wrap with edge blending, cropping, orientation, and scaling options.

**LB-CircleDroste** Circular Droste effect with zoom, spin, and edge blending options. Add an LB-Circle before it for extra vertigo.

**LB-Collide** Kaleidoscope-style radial mirror with options for sampling location, scaling, and edge blending.

**LB-RecordLabel** turns anything into a spinning vinyl record label. 33RPM is still too fast for many things to read, so reduce to taste.

## Drawing

**LB-Graffiti** and **LB-Brush** take brush position as input and draw onto the output

## Util

**LB-Cutout** attempts to erase the "empty" space from around a subject shot on top of a solid background. Works best when the subject is completely surrounded by background. It isn't magic, but can work well for things like simple drawings on white paper.

**LB-KeyStatus** visualizes the alpha channel as black for transparent, white for opaque, and grey for anything in between. Useful to check the output of a color or luma key.
